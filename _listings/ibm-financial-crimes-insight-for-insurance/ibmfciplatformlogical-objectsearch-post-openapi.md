  title: IBM Financial Crimes Insight for Insurance API Retrieve business objects
    using the specified parameters
  description: "This method provides searches for business objects within the database.
    \ The results for searching on a time stamp field are affected by the way that
    DB2\xC2\xAE handles time stamps. The JSON string uses ISO format for time stamps,
    such as 2016-06-15T20:11:19.326-04:00. DB2 converts this value to 2016-06-15-20.11.19.326000.
    Because DB2 might add more precision by storing a time stamp as 2016-06-15-20.11.19.326nnnn,
    the search results might not return what is expected. Refer to your DB2 documentation
    for more information on time stamps."
