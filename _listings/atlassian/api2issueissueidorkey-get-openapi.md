  title: Jira Cloud API Get issue
  description: |-
    Returns a full representation of the issue for the given issue key.

    The issue JSON consists of the issue key and a collection of fields. Additional information like links to workflow transition sub-resources, or HTML rendered values of the fields supporting HTML rendering can be retrieved with `expand` request parameter specified.

    The `fields` request parameter accepts a comma-separated list of fields to include in the response. It can be used to retrieve a subset of fields. By default all fields are returned in the response. A particular field can be excluded from the response if prefixed with a "-" (minus) sign. Parameter can be provided multiple times on a single request.

    By default, all fields are returned in the response. Note: this is different from a JQL search - only navigable fields are returned by default (`*navigable`).
